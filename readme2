The science frames always present noises, cosmetic defects or heterogeneity between pixels (in other words raws)
and I have to perform several operations to correct them before the analising step. The operations on the images 
depend on the kind of observation. In this case, this software has been developed with the goal to prepare the 
science frames for photometric studies. The correction steps are:

1. Application of Bad Pixel Mask to all frames.
2. Creation of Master Bias.
3. Creation of Master Flat.
4. Application of masters to STD star and science frames.
5. Remove the cosmic rays.
6. Sky subtraction.
7. Aligning science frames.
8. Astrometrization.
9. Flux calibration.

It requires bias frames, skyflat frames, photometric standard star frames and science frames.

The generated results consist of one image per observed band. In each image, the following processes will have
been applied: bias subtraction, flat-field correction (and fringing correction in the case of Sloan z), image 
alignment and stacking, astrometric calibration, and photometric calibration (estimation of the ZP Â± error). 
To remove cosmetic effects, a BPM is used, and the LACosmic algorithm is applied to handle cosmic rays.




The first one will be the root directory. You should have concern for the standard
structure. The directory with the frames must be as "<Your_Program>_<Your_OB>/".
Inside, it must create a raw directory where you will store the original frames.
During the execution, sausero will create other folder called as "reduced" where
the reduced frames will be saved.

The second one needs that you create an account in Astrometry.net. You will find
astrometry api key and paste it in configuration file.

After you finish to fill and save the configuration file, if you execute the code
again, it will run in this ocassion.

About the results, you will find the your frame directory a new collection of the 
frames. It will have:

A. Each science frame reduced, in other words, once the master bias and master
flat have been applied. Each frame is saved two time, one with sky and another
without sky.
B. Once aligned both cases.
C. They have after been applied the astrometrization.
D. A PNG file showing the sources in the FoV.
E. A PNG file showing the STD star.
F. Final reduced science frames with sky and without sky.

WARNING: By default, the internal configuration always avoid to share data with 
the astrometry.net community. So that's why your data are safe using
astrometry.net.

## Project Structure

        BPM/
            BPM_OSIRIS_PLUS.fits -> BAD PIXEL MASK
        config/
            configuration.json   -> Configuration file.
        aligning_osirisplus.py   -> Aligns the science frames. 
        astrometry_osirisplus.py -> Astrometrization of the science frames.
        Color_Codes.py           -> Gives color to the comments
        OsirisDRP.py             -> Handles all the sofware and manages the frames. 
        photometry_osirisplus.py -> Carries out the photometric calibration.
        reduction_osirisplus.py  -> Carries out the clean process.

## Note about the frames

The code is designed to work with __OSIRIS+__ frames. They must be in __FITS__ format.
