The science frames always present noises, cosmetic defects or heterogeneity between pixels (in other words raws)
and I have to perform several operations to correct them before the analising step. The operations on the images 
depend on the kind of observation. In this case, this software has been developed with the goal to prepare the 
science frames for photometric studies. The correction steps are:

1. Application of Bad Pixel Mask to all frames.
2. Creation of Master Bias.
3. Creation of Master Flat.
4. Application of masters to STD star and science frames.
5. Remove the cosmic rays.
6. Sky subtraction.
7. Aligning science frames.
8. Astrometrization.
9. Flux calibration.

It requires bias frames, skyflat frames, photometric standard star frames and science frames.

The generated results consist of one image per observed band. In each image, the following processes will have
been applied: bias subtraction, flat-field correction (and fringing correction in the case of Sloan z), image 
alignment and stacking, astrometric calibration, and photometric calibration (estimation of the ZP Â± error). 
To remove cosmetic effects, a BPM is used, and the LACosmic algorithm is applied to handle cosmic rays.
